Question

1. 난이도를 넣는다는게 무슨 말인지... $F_b$의 난이도?
2. 모든 error pattern에 대해서 문제 없이 끝나야 한다?
3. $F_b$는 벡터? 행렬?
4. decoder는 행렬 연산? 벡터 연산?
5. 첫번째 e에서 code word와 error pattern 분리 어떻게?
6. Code word generation matrix와 $F_b$ generation matrix(gallager)

To do

1. error pattern, code word 표 찾아서 넣기

2. Decoder 원리

3. codeword 생성 방법

## Decoder

### 1. Parameters Decoder

- Input : $F_b$, error
- result : codeword

#### 1.1 What is $F_b$?(TBW)

(Vector? Matrix?) which is generated by gallager's way



#### 1.2 Error

##### How to generate Error?

`e` is a binary result of SHA-256 and it can be separated by `errorPattern` + `codeword`

Error patterns are denoted as $ep_n$ and codeword is denoted as `c` and it has a same length with error pattern
$$
e = ep_n + c
$$
#### 1.3 Error Pattern

Example : 1 bit error
$$
ep_1 = \underbrace{[1,0,0, ... ,0]}_{256},
$$

$$
ep_2 = \underbrace{[0,1,0, ... ,0]}_{256},
$$

$$
.
$$

$$
.
$$

$$
ep_{256} = \underbrace{[0,0,0, ... ,1]}_{256}
$$

Number of n bit error pattern in $2^{256}$,
$$
\binom{256}{n}
$$
Therefore, If `t errorPattern` exists means,
$$
ep_1 + ep_2 + ep_3 + ... + ep_t = \binom{256}{1} + \binom {256}{2} + \binom {256}{3} + ... + \binom {256}{t}
$$
It can be expressed as matrix

#### 1.3 Codeword(TBW)

denote codeword as c, message as m and $G$ is generation matrix
$$
c = G * m
$$
If codeword is good one, then $F_b * c$ is 0 martix.

We already know that $c = G*m$ and it means
$$
F_b*(G*m) = 0, \forall{m}	\\
\therefore F_b*G = 0
$$


### 2. How decoder works

#### 2.1 Decoding Process

1. Put a block information and nonce to SHA-256 then we can get a $2^{256}$ binary.

2. Put a $F_b$ and result of SHA-256 to Decoder. then we can get a codeword which is denoted as c
   $$
   Decoder(F_b, e) = c
   $$

3. Multiply $F_b$ and codeword. If result is 0 then this codeword is answer. If result is not 0, then change nonce and repeat this process.
